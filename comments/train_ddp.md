`from __future__ import ...:` 

These are special import statements used in Python 2 to make the code compatible with Python 3 features. They enable certain syntax or behaviors that will be standard in future versions of Python.

`from tensorboardX import SummaryWriter:`

SummaryWriter is part of the TensorBoardX library, which is used for visualizing training runs. It's often employed to monitor metrics like loss and accuracy during training.

`from torch.amp import autocast:`

The autocast module is used for automatic mixed-precision (AMP) training. It allows the use of lower-precision data types for certain operations, improving training speed and reducing memory usage.

`save_model`:

- **Parameters:**
  - `epoch`: The current epoch number.
  - `model`: The PyTorch model to be saved.
  - `type_name`: A string indicating the type of model (optional, default is an empty string).

- **Explanation:**
  1. `model_to_save`: Determines whether the model is wrapped in `torch.nn.DataParallel`. If it is, it extracts the underlying model using `model.module`, otherwise, it uses the original model.
  2. `output_model_file`: Constructs the file path for saving the model. It includes the epoch number and an optional type name.
  3. `torch.save(model_to_save.state_dict(), output_model_file)`: Saves the state dictionary of the model to the specified file path.
  4. `logger.info("Model saved to %s", output_model_file)`: Logs a message indicating that the model has been saved to the specified file.

### `train_epoch` Function:

- **Parameters:**
  - `epoch`: The current epoch number.
  - `args`: Command-line arguments.
  - `model`: The PyTorch model.
  - `train_dataloader`: The data loader for training data.
  - `device`: The device (GPU) on which the model and data reside.
  - `optimizer`: The optimizer for updating model parameters.
  - `scheduler`: The learning rate scheduler (optional, can be `None`).
  - `global_step`: The global training step.

- **Explanation:**
  1. `model.train()`: Puts the model in training mode, enabling gradients and dropout.
  2. `log_step`: The frequency at which training logs are printed.
  3. The function then iterates over batches in the training data.
  4. `torch.cuda.empty_cache()`: Clears GPU memory to avoid memory overflow.
  5. `batch = tuple(t.to(device) for t in batch)`: Moves the batch data to the specified device.
  6. `with autocast(device_type='cuda')`: Uses automatic mixed-precision (AMP) for training.
  7. `loss = model(*batch, train=True)`: Computes the loss for the given batch in training mode.
  8. `loss.backward()`: Backpropagates the gradients.
  9. `torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), 1.0)`: Clips the gradient norms to prevent exploding gradients.
  10. `if scheduler is not None: scheduler.step()`: Adjusts the learning rate if a scheduler is provided.
  11. `optimizer.step()`: Updates the model parameters.
  12. `optimizer.zero_grad()`: Zeroes the gradients for the next iteration.
  13. `model.module.clamp_logit_scale()`: Applies a method (specific to the model) to clamp the logit scale.
  14. Logging information is printed at the specified log frequency.
  15. The total loss for the epoch and the updated global step are returned.
